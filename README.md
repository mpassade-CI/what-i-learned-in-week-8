# **What I Learned in Week 8**

### Flexbox

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

* The flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to flex:

    div {<br/>display: flex <br/>}

* The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.
* The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.
* The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.
* The justify-content property is used to align the flex items:
* The align-items property is used to align the flex items vertically.
* The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.
